               Started a playtest session. Added some colliders to stop the player from going out of bounds. Changed the letter UI panel to make it more readable for the player. Came across error where, if they player goes from the Main menu to a scene and back to the menu, the ‘Start game’ button seems to not work any more. 


Fixed issue where the final enemy would still spawn as the final animation was playing. Now the enemy spawner is set to off when the animation starts. Fixed the Main Menu issue from Monday. The issue came from a wait function on the ‘Start Button’. 
Change colour of ‘Where am I’ text. Added UI text for pickups. Now, when the player picks up the pistol or flashlight, text will show up on screen for a moment confirming the pickup. Added this for all keys in the house. Now, when the player picks up a key, a message appears in the top left corner of the screen to denote a key pick up. Fixed ‘Quit to desktop’ button on all scenes. It now exits the application.
 Added a UI component that activates when the pistol is picked up. Shows ammunition count that adds when the player picks up an ammunition box. The counter goes down until the player runs out of ammunition. Also added one for the flashlight. When the light has more than 10 seconds of battery, a green indicator will show, then amber, then red until it runs out of battery.  Fixed Cupboards in kitchen. 
 
 Moved the keys in the house to their final positions cupboards, safes etc. Fixed big issue where, when the player is using a keypad or in a menu, their equipped item would activate on the mouse press (The flashlight would turn on/ the gun would fire).
