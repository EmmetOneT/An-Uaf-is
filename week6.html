                   Started my boat scene/ first area. Added, a terrain and planes for my ocean. Added fog & skybox. Added animation of boat rocking back and forth in water.  Added boat and colliders all around. Added Player character for testing. Created a rain particle system and added rain audio. Added door open and close audio



 Added a captain of the ship character. Had an issue with adding the canvas from my test scene and spent some time trying to sort it out. After some testing and research, I found out that a canvas can be buggy when copy and pasting between scenes in Unity. To remedy my Canvas issue, I had to create a new canvas in the scene and from there, could drag and drop my dialogue prefab. I added an animator to the captain character who, is a child of the boat so, he also rocks back and forth with the boat. 
 Added safe and letter to BoatScene. Created a sliding puzzle game in a new 2d scene to open a chest. Added a fade in and out “blink” when transitioning between scenes
 As I was going back and forth between my test scene and newer, I had accidentally deleted my safe model which, was saved in my games folder. Thankfully I had uploaded the 3d model to github with my daily pushes, so, I was able to grab it from  my repository. Tried working on an exit button from the safe keypad. At the moment, the safe keypad adds digits added by the player to a string which, I cant reset on exit. Added an animation of the opened chest in the 2d game. 
 
 Completed first level including the puzzle scene. Player can open the safe, talk to the captain and start the puzzle game from the box. When the puzzle is complete, an animation of the box opening shows and a letter is present on screen
