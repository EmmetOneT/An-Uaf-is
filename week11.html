                      Placed all keys in final positions in safes/ where the player can find them. Had an issue when using more than one letter in the scene. The game manager tries to activate multiple LetterTextDisplays. Fixed issue by simplifying by activating and deactivating a TMP gameobject on interacting with the individual letter. 
Completed adding all notes and letters. Added last of riddles. 
Fully set up zombie enemies. Player can now be killed by this enemy type.
Fixed some bugs such as zombie attacking after death and attack collider. Added sound outside mansion, fixed some canvas box sizes. Added a settings menu in the main menu. Created a volume mute and volume slider. Created a global variable so, when the player switches scenes, the volume stay at what they set it at. 
 Added a change resolution setting to main menu options. Added a toggle for fullscreen. These settings save through the game. Started working with shaders
 Had a big issue trying to move my render pipeline from the Universal render Pipeline to the Built in render Pipeline. Worked on reverting back to my last git commit. Made a local save of my project, deleted the file in my github folder and re-cloned from Github to my desktop. Started adding PS1 style jitter and pixellation to my Boat Scene. To do this I have to create a new material for every model that I want the jitter on and replace the old one.
