                      Read through brief. Noted all applications to be used for documentation such as Excel and Trello. Started design document and filling out Excel sheet for project timeline. 
                      Finished Design document. Started filling out Trello board of tasks which need to be done for video game
                      Downloaded and set up applications to be used for project (Unity, GIMP, Blender) Gathered applicable resources for project such as model assets, textures and sounds to be used. Set up test scene and first person player controller 

                      Set up Enemy Idle and Walking animation. Set up NavMesh. Enemy AI now follows character with walking animation. Used MusOpen to download royalty free classical music. Used Audacity to edit the music by adding reverb and reversing the classical music to create ambient music for the game.  
                      Set up music trigger when enemy spawns. Random time on enemy spawn and despawn. Enemy Spawns at a random point around the player on the navmesh. Spawn set up so, enemy spawns a certain distance from the player for fairness. Player screen shakes when enemy gets close. Added post processing so the screen goes grey and has a fuzzy film grain when enemy gets close. Player slows down when enemy spawns. Set up items with box colliders and rigidbodies to be ready to be picked up.
