                Brought the Gun, ammo and following zombies into mansion scene. Set up the first zombie spawn trigger in the library. This is set up after the player gets a weapon. Set nav mesh agent for walkable and non walkable props. 
 Built frame of final level. The attic. Added scene transition brought in openable doors .

Finished creating ‘maze’ out of furniture props. Adding spinning and beating crystal heart to be destroyed at the end. Added and generated lighting. 
Added a hidden staircase to the attic that can only be accessed when found the letter and key to the attic. The starcase is accessed by interacting with a picture. The picture slides away using a Tween position. The players controls get disabled as the camera moves towards the door and camera fades to black. The player is then teleported to the attic.  Brought final enemy into scene and made the spawner component activate with a box collider when the player is at a comfortable distance into the attic level. 
 Worked on final animation
 Fixed animation. The issue came from the created animations not being set to ‘Legacy’ in the debug options. Added Blinking to animation. Added a Game finished canvas where, the player can go back to the main menu. Added death screen to player. Here, the player can restart the level or go back to main menu. Changed volume and door sound of all doors in Mansion.
