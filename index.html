                    <h3>What is An Uafáis</h3>
                    <p>
                      An Uafáis is a short horror first-person game built from start to finish by me, Emmet Carroll. It was built to fill out criteria for a simulted work experience over the course of 12 weeks. The game tries to replicate the original Playstations graphics. Low Poly, slightly pixellated graphics are a staple of this aesthetic. Video games like Silent Hill and Resident evil for the original PSX(Playstation 1) and Alone in the dark for the PC were some of the original 'Survival horror' games of the 90s where, the player would have limited ammunition for guns and other finite resources to use to complete their adventure. In my game, the playewr will find a flashlight and pistol with ammunition and batteries strewn throughout the house. Theres letters to find whilch will clear the story along with riddles and puzzles.

                      Read through brief. Noted all applications to be used for documentation such as Excel and Trello. Started design document and filling out Excel sheet for project timeline. 
                      Finished Design document. Started filling out Trello board of tasks which need to be done for video game
                      Downloaded and set up applications to be used for project (Unity, GIMP, Blender) Gathered applicable resources for project such as model assets, textures and sounds to be used. Set up test scene and first person player controller 

                      Set up Enemy Idle and Walking animation. Set up NavMesh. Enemy AI now follows character with walking animation. Used MusOpen to download royalty free classical music. Used Audacity to edit the music by adding reverb and reversing the classical music to create ambient music for the game.  
                      Set up music trigger when enemy spawns. Random time on enemy spawn and despawn. Enemy Spawns at a random point around the player on the navmesh. Spawn set up so, enemy spawns a certain distance from the player for fairness. Player screen shakes when enemy gets close. Added post processing so the screen goes grey and has a fuzzy film grain when enemy gets close. Player slows down when enemy spawns. Set up items with box colliders and rigidbodies to be ready to be picked up.

                       Road cycling is an activity most commonly performed on a bicycle. Road cycling in its modern form was invented in Germany on Aug 12, 1817. There are many types of bicycles that are used on the roads including: BMX, recumbents, racing, touring and utility bicycles.Dedicated road bicycles have drop handlebars and multiple gears, although there are single and fixed gear varieties. Road bikes also use narrow, high-pressure tires to decrease rolling resistance, and tend to be somewhat lighter than other types of bicycle. The drop handlebars are often positioned lower than the saddle in order to put the rider in a more aerodynamic position. In an effort to become more aerodynamic, some riders have begun using aerobars.[1] Who and when aerobars where invented is unclear but they seem to date back to the early 1980s.[2] The light weight and aerodynamics of a road bike allows this type of bicycle to be the second most efficient self-powered means of transportation, behind only recumbent bicycles due to the latter's higher aerodynamic efficiency.Mountain bikes fitted with slick or semi-slick are also popular for commuters. Though less efficient, the upright riding position allows the cyclist a better view of traffic, and they can also be readily fitted with mudguards, cargo racks and other accessories. Mountain bikes are usually ridden on unpaved roads and tracks but they are not to be confused with cyclocross bikes. A hybrid form of road cycling has been gaining solid ground lately called cyclo-cross. Cyclo-cross (sometimes CCX, CX, cyclocross) is bicycling off-road and not to be confused with mountain biking. Cyclo-cross bikes are nearly identical to traditional road bikes but tend to have a longer wheelbase, a higher bottom-bracket for improved clearance over obstacles and tread on their tires for the purpose of riding on unpaved roads and rough trails.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_cycling">more text...</a>

                    <h3>BMX Bike</h3>

                      The word BMX is an acronym for Bicycle Moto Cross. The term was originated in the 1970’s when kids started racing their bikes on dirt tracks in southern California. The origination was focused on the racing side of things with an emphasis on the jumping, speed and style. It wasn’t long until tricks started making their way into this new sport and a whole new genre of BMX was formed. BMX racing and Freestyle BMX.As we mentioned above, BMX stands for Bicycle Moto Cross. The term originally coined by those kids racing their bikes on dirt tracks imitating dirt bikes or motocross racers. However, the meaning has expanded quite a bit over the years and could mean a number of things. When a BMX rider tells somebody that they “ride BMX”, it could mean anything from BMX racing to BMX freestyle where they might ride street, parks, dirt jumps or flatland. They might even get into a little bit of everything. Typically we find racing and freestyle separated since they are quite literally different worlds. For instance, BMX Union focuses on the freestyle aspect because the racing side is a whole thing on its own with many different brands (some brands do make both racing and freestyle products such as Profile Racing and S&M Bikes for an example), sponsored riders, events and more that only cater to racing, much like freestyle has events that only cater to freestyle. We grew up on freestyle and have only raced a few times for fun, so we leave it to the racing experts to cover that side of the sport.<a href="https://bmxunion.com/what-is-bmx-what-does-it-mean/">more text...</a>
